## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this project, I deepened my understanding of using **Flexbox** for layout structuring. Using the column and row Flexbox arrangement. Flexbox allowed me to easily center elements within the webpage by leveraging properties like justify-content and align-items. This made aligning content more efficient. With Flexbox, I could quickly align my elements horizontally and vertically, creating a more responsive and visually balanced design.

Additionally, I gained experience working with **Class selectors** in CSS. I learned how to target specific elements using their unique ID attributes to apply distinct styles for text formatting and spacing. This was useful in the case where I needed to apply styles to one particular element, while class selectors were effective for reusable styles across multiple elements.

I also learned to style hyper links.

```html
<body>
  <main>
    <div class="top">
      <img class="ill" alt="illustration-art" src="images/illustration-article.svg"/>
      <h1>Learning</h1>
      <p>Published 21 Dec 2023</p>
      <h2>HTML & CSS foundations</h2>
      <p class="par">These languages are the backbone of every website, defining structure, content, and presentation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="footer">
      <img class="avater" alt="image-avater" src="images/image-avatar.webp"/>
      <p class="par1" >Greg Hooper</p>
    </div>
  </main>  
</body>
```

```css
h2{
    font-size: 24px;
    font-weight: bolder;
    padding-top: 6px;
    padding-bottom: 6px;
    transition: color 200ms ease-in-out;
}
h2:hover{
    color: #F4D04E;
}
```

### Continued development

Code will be reviewed to make sure it absolutely responsive across multiple devices.
